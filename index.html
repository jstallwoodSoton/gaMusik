            <h1>Hypotheses</h1>
            <p>Let \(h = (\nu_{i} \mid i = 1, \dots, 32)\) be an ordered sequence of 32 attributes (notes). Each attribute, \(\nu \in h\), may take on one of 18 values (tones) - semitones from "c4" to "e5" and including a "rest".</p>
            <p>Let \(t = (\nu_{i} \mid i = 1, \dots, 32)\) be a "target sequence". Let \(P = \{h \mid |P| = 1000\}\). A hypothesis sequence \(h \in P\) has a score, denoted \(s(h)\), which is a measure of how closely it matches the target sequence.</p>
            <p>In each epoch, \(\epsilon\), 200 "offspring hypotheses", \(C = \{h \mid |C|\}\) will be created by mixing-and-matching sequences from two selected "parent" hypotheses. The best performing of the existing population will be kept and the rest will be replaced by the generated offspring. When an offspring is created, there is a 5% chance that it will mutate its sequence by exchanging some of its existing elements for others.</p>
            <p>The process will continue until the best performing hypothesis converges on \(t\).</p>
            <h1>The interactive sketch</h1>
            <p>The sketch below will perform this generation automatically until a familiar tune is played. It would be best not to have your volume too high. Further, certain browsers may require the page to be refreshed as recent browser technology appears to dislike audio autoplay features.</p>
            <p>Enjoy! - James</p>
